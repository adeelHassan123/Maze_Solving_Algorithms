This project implements and compares three popular maze-solving algorithms:

Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
A* Search Algorithm
Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
The project provides a platform for visualizing and analyzing the performance of each algorithm based on:

Path Length: The number of steps taken to reach the goal.
Execution Time: Time taken by each algorithm to find the solution.
Using the pyamaze library, the maze environment is created and visualized. The algorithms explore the maze, with agents moving along the paths, showing both the search process and the found path. The comparison of the algorithms includes:

Path Length: Comparing how long each algorithm takes to reach the goal.
Execution Time: Measuring the time efficiency of each algorithm.
Key Features:

Customizable maze sizes and complexities.
Real-time algorithm visualization with agent movement.
Path length and time comparisons to evaluate performance.
Clear and interactive visualizations to show the different exploration methods of each algorithm.
This project aims to provide insights into the efficiency and behavior of different search algorithms when applied to maze-solving tasks, helping users understand the trade-offs between speed and solution quality.
